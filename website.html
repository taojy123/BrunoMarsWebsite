                    Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985), professionally known by his stage name Bruno Mars, 
                    is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, voice actor, and choreographer. 
                    Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, by a family of musicians, 
                    Mars began making music at a young age and performed in various musical venues in his hometown throughout his childhood. 
                    He graduated from high school and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a musical career. 
                    Mars produced songs for other artists, co-founding the production team: The Smeezingtons.

                Mars had an unsuccessful stint with Motown Records, but then signed with Atlantic in 2009. 
                He became recognized as a solo artist after lending his vocals to the songs "Nothin' on You" by B.o.B, 
                and "Billionaire" by Travie McCoy, which were worldwide successes, and for which he co-wrote the hooks. 
                Mars' production formula allowed him, and his production team, 
                to work with an assortment of artists from various genres.
